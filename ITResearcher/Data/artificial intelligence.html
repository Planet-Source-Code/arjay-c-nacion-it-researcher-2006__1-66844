The term was coined in 1956 by John McCarthy at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Artificial intelligence includes</p>
      <p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; <strong>games  playing:</strong> programming computers to play games such as chess and checkers <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; <strong>expert systems</strong> <strong>:</strong> programming computers to make decisions in real-life situations (for  example, some expert systems &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;help doctors diagnose diseases based on symptoms) <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; <strong>natural  language</strong> <strong>:</strong> programming computers to understand natural human languages <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; <strong>neural networks</strong> <strong>:</strong> Systems that  simulate intelligence by attempting to reproduce the types of physical  connections that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;occur in animal brains <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; <strong>robotics</strong> <strong>:</strong> programming computers to <em>see</em> and <em>hear</em> and react to other sensory  stimuli</p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style2">Currently, no computers exhibit full  artificial intelligence (that is, are able to simulate human behavior). The  greatest advances have occurred in the field of games playing. The best  computer chess programs are now capable of beating humans. </span></p>
      <p align="justify"><span class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May, 1997, an IBM  super-computer called <em>Deep Blue</em> defeated world chess champion Gary  Kasparov in a chess match. In the area of robotics, computers are now  widely used in assembly plants, but they are capable only of very limited  tasks. Robots have great difficulty identifying objects based on appearance or  feel, and they still move and handle objects clumsily. <br />
        <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="style2">Natural-language processing offers the  greatest potential rewards because it would allow people to interact with  computers without needing any specialized knowledge. You could simply walk up  to a computer and talk to it. Unfortunately, programming computers to  understand natural languages has proved to be more difficult than originally  thought. Some rudimentary translation systems that translate from one human language  to another are in existence, but they are not nearly as good as human  translators. There are also voice recognition systems that can convert spoken  sounds into written words, but they do not <em>understand</em> what they are  writing; they simply take dictation. Even these systems are quite limited --  you must speak slowly and distinctly. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="style2">In the early 1980s, expert systems were  believed to represent the future of artificial intelligence and of computers in  general. To date, however, they have not lived up to expectations. Many expert  systems help human experts in such fields as medicine and engineering, but they  are very expensive to produce and are helpful only in special situations. Today, the hottest area of artificial  intelligence is neural networks, which are proving successful in a number of  disciplines such as voice recognition and natural-language processing. There are several programming languages that  are known as AI languages because they are used almost exclusively for AI applications. The two  most common are <em>LISP</em> and <em>Prolog</em>. </span></p>    </td>
