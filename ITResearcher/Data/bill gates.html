        Chairman<br />
        Microsoft Corporation</strong></p>
      <p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William (Bill) H. Gates is chairman of Microsoft Corporation, the worldwide  leader in software, services and solutions that help people and businesses  realize their full potential. Microsoft had revenues of US$39.79 billion for  the fiscal year ending June 2005, and employs more than 61,000 people in 102  countries and regions. On June 15, 2006, Microsoft announced that effective July 2008 Gates will  transition out of a day-to-day role in the company to spend more time on his  global health and education work at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.  After July 2008 Gates will continue to serve as Microsoft&rsquo;s chairman and an  advisor on key development projects. The two-year transition process is to  ensure that there is a smooth and orderly transfer of Gates&rsquo; daily  responsibilities. Effective June 2006, Ray Ozzie has assumed Gates&rsquo; previous  title as chief software architect and is working side by side with Gates on all  technical architecture and product oversight responsibilities at Microsoft.  Craig Mundie has assumed the new title of chief research and strategy officer  at Microsoft and is working closely with Gates to assume his responsibility for  the company&rsquo;s research and incubation efforts.</p>
      <p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born on Oct. 28, 1955,  Gates grew up in Seattle  with his two sisters. Their father, William H. Gates II, is a Seattle attorney. Their late mother, Mary  Gates, was a schoolteacher, University   of Washington regent, and  chairwoman of United Way International. <br />
        Gates attended public elementary school and the private Lakeside School.  There, he discovered his interest in software and began programming computers  at age 13. <br />
        In 1973, Gates entered Harvard   University as a freshman,  where he lived down the hall from Steve Ballmer, now Microsoft's chief  executive officer. While at Harvard, Gates developed a version of the programming  language BASIC for the first microcomputer - the MITS Altair. <br />
        <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;        &nbsp;&nbsp;In his junior year, Gates left Harvard to devote his energies to Microsoft,  a company he had begun in 1975 with his childhood friend Paul Allen. Guided by  a belief that the computer would be a valuable tool on every office desktop and  in every home, they began developing software for personal computers. Gates'  foresight and his vision for personal computing have been central to the  success of Microsoft and the software industry.<br />
        Under Gates' leadership, Microsoft's mission has been to continually advance  and improve software technology, and to make it easier, more cost-effective and  more enjoyable for people to use computers. The company is committed to a  long-term view, reflected in its investment of approximately $6.2 billion on  research and development in the 2005 fiscal year. <br />
        In 1999, Gates wrote <em>Business @ the Speed of Thought</em>, a book that  shows how computer technology can solve business problems in fundamentally new  ways. The book was published in 25 languages and is available in more than 60  countries. <em>Business @ the Speed of Thought</em> has received wide critical  acclaim, and was listed on the best-seller lists of the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>USA  Today</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and Amazon.com. Gates' previous book, <em>The Road Ahead</em>, published in 1995, held the No. 1 spot on the <em>New  York Times</em>' bestseller list for seven weeks. </p>

      <p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gates has donated the proceeds of both books to non-profit organizations  that support the use of technology in education and skills development. <br />
        In addition to his love of computers and software, Gates founded Corbis,  which is developing one of the world's largest resources of visual information  - a comprehensive digital archive of art and photography from public and  private collections around the globe. He is also a member of the board of  directors of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which invests in companies engaged in  diverse business activities.<br />
        Philanthropy is also important to Gates. He and his wife, Melinda, have  endowed a foundation with more than $28.8 billion (as of January 2005) to  support philanthropic initiatives in the areas of global health and learning,  with the hope that in the 21st century, advances in these critical areas will  be available for all people. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has  committed more than $3.6 billion to organizations working in global health;  more than $2 billion to improve learning opportunities, including the Gates  Library Initiative to bring computers, Internet Access and training to public  libraries in low-income communities in the United States and Canada; more than  $477 million to community projects in the Pacific Northwest; and more than $488  million to special projects and annual giving campaigns.</p>
    <span class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gates was married on Jan. 1, 1994, to Melinda French Gates. They  have three children. Gates is an avid reader, and enjoys playing golf and  bridge.</span></div></td>
