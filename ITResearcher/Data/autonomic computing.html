Designed to mimic the human body&rsquo;s nervous system&mdash;in that the  autonomic nervous system acts and reacts to stimuli independent of the  individual&rsquo;s conscious input&mdash;an autonomic computing environment functions with  a high level of artificial intelligence while remaining invisible to the users.  Just as the human body acts and responds without the individual controlling  functions (e.g., internal temperature rises and falls, breathing rate  fluctuates, glands secrete hormones in response to stimulus), the autonomic computing  environment operates organically in response to the input it collects.<br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A leader in autonomic computing design, IBM  has set forth eight conditions that define an autonomic system:</p>
      <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li class="style2">The       system must know itself in terms of what resources it has access to, what       its capabilities and limitations are and how and why it is connected to       other systems. </li>
        <li class="style2">The       system must be able to automatically configure and reconfigure itself       depending on the changing computing environment. </li>
        <li class="style2">The       system must be able to optimize its performance to ensure the most       efficient computing process. </li>
        <li class="style2">The       system must be able to work around encountered problems by either       repairing itself or routing functions away from the trouble. </li>
        <li class="style2">The       system must detect, identify and protect itself against various types of       attacks to maintain overall system security and integrity. </li>
        <li class="style2">The       system must be able to adapt to its environment as it changes, interacting       with neighboring systems and establishing communication protocols. </li>
        <li class="style2">The       system must rely on open standards and cannot exist in a proprietary       environment. </li>
        <li class="style2">The       system must anticipate the demand on its resources while keeping transparent       to users.  </li>
