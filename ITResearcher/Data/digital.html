    <td width="775" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><p align="justify" class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(adj.)</strong> Describes any <strong><em>system</em></strong> based on discontinuous <strong><em>data</em></strong> or events. <strong><em>Computers</em></strong> are digital machines because at their most basic level they can distinguish  between just two values, 0 and 1, or off and on. There is no simple way to  represent all the values in between, such as 0.25. All data that a <strong><em>computer</em></strong> processes must be encoded digitally, as a series of zeroes and ones. <br />
        The opposite of digital is <em><strong>analog</strong></em>. A typical  analog <strong><em>device</em></strong> is a  clock in which the hands move continuously around the face. Such a clock is  capable of indicating every possible time of day. In contrast, a digital clock  is capable of representing only a finite number of times (every tenth of a  second, for example). <br />
        In general, humans experience the world analogically. Vision, for example,  is an analog experience because we perceive infinitely smooth gradations of  shapes and colors. Most analog events, however, can be simulated digitally.  Photographs in newspapers, for instance, consist of an array of <strong><em>dots</em></strong> that are either black  or white. From afar, the viewer does not see the dots (the digital form), but  only lines and shading, which appear to be continuous. Although digital  representations are approximations of analog events, they are useful because  they are relatively easy to <strong><em>store</em></strong> and manipulate electronically. The trick is in <strong><em>converting</em></strong> from analog  to digital, and back again. <br />
        This is the principle behind <strong><em>compact discs</em></strong> (CDs). The music itself exists in an analog form, as waves in the air, but  these sounds are then translated into a digital form that is encoded onto the <strong><em>disk</em></strong>. When you play a  compact disc, the CD player <strong><em>reads</em></strong> the digital data, translates it back into its original analog form, and sends  it to the amplifier and eventually the speakers.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internally, <strong><em>computers</em></strong> are digital because they consist of discrete units called <strong><em>bits</em></strong> that are either on or  off. But by combining many bits in complex ways, computers simulate analog  events. In one sense, this is what <em>computer science</em> is all about.</p></td>
